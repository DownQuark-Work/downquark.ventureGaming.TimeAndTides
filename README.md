# Time & Tides
> A Rogueli(k|t)e in the early stages of active development.

## Concept
Available is an initial high level, _very_ Stream of Consciousness, rough draft of the plot via a [Backstory](./_docs/0.%20Backstory.md)

As well as the beginning of the [Game Mechanics](./_docs/1.%20Mechanix.md) that's (just barely) better than nothing.

### Updates
Will appear as they come in

---
## Resources
A large amount of resources have been placed into an [ideation](./_docs/.ideation) directory. The information may have merit or just be clutter. It will be researched and parsed as development continues.
